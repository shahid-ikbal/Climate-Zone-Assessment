# Climate-Zone-Assessment
Overview
This project visualizes Local Climate Zones (LCZ) for Pakistan using the LCZ Global Dataset. The dataset classifies regions into 17 distinct climate zone categories, making it a valuable tool for urban planning, environmental management, and climate adaptation. The map is customized to highlight LCZ classifications within Pakistan by integrating a shapefile of the Pakistan boundary.

Key Objectives
To provide a comprehensive visualization of Pakistan's Local Climate Zones (LCZ).
To enable better understanding of land use and climate patterns for researchers, students, and urban planners.
To demonstrate how global datasets can be clipped and customized for specific regions of interest.
Features
Clipping to Pakistan Boundary:
The LCZ dataset is clipped to a custom shapefile of Pakistan, ensuring the map focuses only on the region of interest.
Interactive Map Layers:
Displays LCZ classifications using a 17-class color-coded scheme.
Overlays Pakistan's boundary for clear spatial reference.
Dynamic Legend:
Includes a legend describing each LCZ class, with corresponding colors and labels, for easy interpretation.
Dataset Used
LCZ Dataset: RUB/RUBCLIM/LCZ/global_lcz_map/latest
Provides global Local Climate Zone data for environmental and urban studies.
Pakistan Boundary Shapefile: users/shahidiqbal/Pak
A custom boundary shapefile uploaded to Google Earth Engine.
Local Climate Zone Classes
The LCZ dataset includes the following classifications:

Compact High-rise
Compact Mid-rise
Compact Low-rise
Open High-rise
Open Mid-rise
Open Low-rise
Large Low-rise
Sparsely Built
Heavy Industry
Dense Trees
Scattered Trees
Bush/Scrub
Low Plants
Bare Rock or Paved
Bare Soil or Sand
Water
Snow and Ice
Each class is visualized using a unique color palette for clarity.

How It Works
Pakistan Boundary Integration:
A shapefile of Pakistan is used to clip the global LCZ data to the country’s boundary, isolating only the relevant classifications.
LCZ Visualization:
The map applies a predefined color palette to represent the 17 LCZ classes.
Interactive Legend:
A dynamic legend is included to explain the color-coded LCZ classes, making the map user-friendly and informative.
Applications
Urban Planning:
Identify urban areas such as high-rise and low-rise zones for infrastructure development.
Climate Adaptation:
Study land cover patterns to assess climate risks and resilience.
Environmental Management:
Analyze vegetation, water bodies, and other natural zones for conservation efforts.
Education and Research:
Serve as an educational tool for understanding local climate zones in Pakistan.
Expected Output
A color-coded map showing Pakistan’s Local Climate Zones (LCZ) with detailed classifications and a legend for easy interpretation.
Why This Project Matters
This project combines global datasets with local geographic data to offer a region-specific analysis of climate zones. It highlights the power of geospatial technologies like Google Earth Engine for environmental and urban studies, making it accessible for students, researchers, and policymakers.
